# Final Project for CSC 337
**e_commerce**

This is a e-commerce demo built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Users can create accounts, log in, browse sellers, add items to a cart, and make purchases. Sellers can add items to their shelves and manage their own product listings.

Dependencies used in the project include: express, path, fs, crypto, and mongodb.

To install the dependencies, run: 
`npm install express mongodb`

To start the server, run: 
`node server.js`

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

From there you can test account creation, logging in, managing carts, and viewing seller pages.
